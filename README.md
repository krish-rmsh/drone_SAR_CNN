This repository contains all the notebooks and scripts used for my master's thesis, titled "A Study on the Application of Neural Networks in Drone-Based Search and Rescue Operations."

Note: Version control was not implemented during the initial experimentation phases of this project. This repository serves as a final collection of code, uploaded post-completion of the thesis.
